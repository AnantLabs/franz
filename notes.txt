refactor:
-read and write functionality for the queue in seperate traits (with one that combines both)
-Implementation trait for eveything but send and nextStringBatchWithLock
-Subclass for Json (with consistent names, i.e. no more type in method names)
-send takes object with a source trait that can be subclassed for different message types
-above object also has payload (or maybe LargeMessage sub trait that handles S3 storage trnsparently and only when needed?)
-Use AWS async client (with AsyncHandler, not using the returned future)
